<!--What is it all about?-->

<!--Popup boxes are used for interacting with the user. It can be error messages or something where the user has to make a decision or enter something. In general you work with four types of popups:-->
<!--Alert box-->
<!--Confirm box-->
<!--Prompt box-->
<!--Modal box-->
<!--Of these, modal box is not a specific command in JavaScript, so this is shown on another page. Modal box also has some options that are not available for alert, confirm and prompt, which is why many new websites often uses modal box.-->


<!--Alert Box-->

<!--Alert boxes are popup-messages, where you can only click OK, when you have read it. The syntax is window.alert(), or just alert().-->

<!--A button that displays a message upon click, looks like this as code:-->

<BUTTON TYPE="button" ONCLICK="alert('Hello there!')">Click me!</BUTTON>
