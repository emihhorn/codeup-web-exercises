<h1>Come to Charleston</h1>

A favorite for locals and visitors alike is <strong>White Point Garden</strong>, sometimes called <em>"Battery Park."</em> <br>
Where you will find amazing large oak trees, several Civil War relics and memorials. Kids love to <br>
climb on the cannons which makes for a great photo. From there you can take a lovely stroll down <br>
the Charleston harbor with a view of the water on one side and antebellum mansions on the other. <br>
<br>
Charleston is also known for their Historic Horse and Carriage Tours, learn more about Charleston's rich history<br>
on a guided tour of the <em>"Holy City"</em>. Large beautiful draft horses will take you down cobblestone streets <br>
on a scenic route of the city, with views of mansions, enchanting gardens and churches.<br>

<br>Another iconic stop in Charleston is the <em>Pineapple Fountain</em> located in the heart of <strong>Waterfront Park.</strong><br>
Where you'll find panoramic views of the Charleston Harbor, two large fountains fantastic for photo opportunities and fun <br>
for all ages to splash in and cool off. Walking down to the pier that extends into the Cooper River take a break in the <br>
covered family size swings. At the far end of the pier gaze at the Arthur Ravenel Junior Bridge, the USS Yorktown, Castle Pinckney <br>
and Fort Sumter. Here you can take a Charleston water taxi to see and photograph some friendly dolphins on the way to Patriot Point <br>
and back. Relax and enjoy the views of historic sites from the water and see some of Charleston's most visited attractions.
